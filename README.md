# React Pomodoro Clock
*__This is the code I wrote to complete the freeCodeCamp "Pomodoro Clock" challenge.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance. 

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:** 

- Set the "Break Length" or "Session Length" by clicking the "up" or "down" arrows.
- Clicking "Start", starts the time and changes to "Started".
- Once the text has changed from "Start" to "Started," you can click "Started" to "Stop" the clock.
- Click "Stop" to restart the clock when you are ready to.
- "Reset" should reset the timer at any given moment, whether the timer has started or stopped. 
- "View Break Timer" will show you the break timer.

**Side Note:** 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code; or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
